[Annihilation](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2798920/) has an enchanting dreamy vibe, which makes it pleasant to watch. Unfortunately it allows the script to cheat, and illogical and irrational decisions by the characters are too easily explained away by just claiming their target has mysterious effects on their minds.
