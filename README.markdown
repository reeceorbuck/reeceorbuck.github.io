# Jekyll-IndieWeb

Welcome to Jekyll-Indieweb. The goal of this project was to provide someone without a web presence a quick and easy way to start using the basics of the [Indieweb](https://indiewebcamp.com).

## Motivation

I've followed along a few [IndieWeb Camps](https://indiewebcamp.com/IWC) and observed a few people new to both the indieweb as well as having their own web presence. I wanted to provide another option for those users to have a fairly simple method to easily get up and going with with a web site ready for indieweb and be able to dive in.

## Installation

This web site template can be run with a standalone [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or, even easier, using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). Using the latter you'll have your web site up and running in minutes if you follow these steps:

1. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com) account if you haven't already.
2. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/miklb/jekyll-indieweb) to create a copy of it in your own GitHub account.
3. Change the name of the repository to _somestring_.github.io (e.g. _myindiewebpage.github.io_).
4. Use GitHub's own editor to change a file (e.g. the _about.md_ in the root of the repository) and commit the change.
5. You did it. Your web site should now be available via http://_somestring_.github.io (e.g. http://myindiewebpage.github.io).

## Usage

If you use the GitHub pages workflow described in the _Installation_ section, the usage of this template is fairly simple. Everytime you change something at your web site and commit this change using _git commit_ or the GitHub editor, Jekyll is triggered and your website is redeployed at the URL specified by your repository name (in the example above http://myindiewebpage.github.io).

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D
